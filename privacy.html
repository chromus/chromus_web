                <div class="text">
                    <p>Chromus, Inc. (chromus) respects your privacy and recognizes the need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information, such as your name, email address and any other personally identifiable information you may provide to us.

                    <p>Chromus is a browser extension that works by playling mp3 from site vk.com. It updates your last.fm page by it's own play buttons. Any mp3 file indexed is then available for playback in the extension, originating from the posted location. In addition to personal information you might voluntarily provide when you sign up, by the nature of its functionality, chromus software collects information regarding your Internet usage. Privacy controls include: deleting any individual item that you have visited and preventing the site from auto-updating songs into your music.</p>

Information collected about you is protected in several ways. Access by you to your personal information if you sign up for an account is available through a password and unique user ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted.

You may also request that we delete all personal and/or non-personal information that we have collected about you. We will promptly fulfill your request and provide you confirmation when the information has been deleted.</p>
                    <p>Because the Internet is constantly evolving, so are our policies.
